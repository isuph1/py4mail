# py4mail
Local Messaging Application created by Vue.js and py4web

## Description:
Py4Mail is a locally-based email application specifically developed for facilitating communication between users. Inspired by popular email services like Gmail, Py4Mail offers a range of standard features including support for multiple user accounts, seamless sending and receiving of emails, as well as the ability to block and unblock users. The application is built using a combination of Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, and py4web, a Python framework.

## Design and Documentation:
During the design and implementation process of the email web application, the team collaborated to ensure a user-friendly and functional experience. 
 - Design: The team conducted brainstorming sessions to gather ideas and insights on the key features and functionality of the email web application. We review our favorite email applications and used ideas to implement for Py4Mail
 - User Interface Design: The team focused on creating a user interface. The design aimed to provide a clean and organized layout, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the application's functionalities.
 - Development and Implementation: Once the design was finalized, the team used the design and specifications to implement the user interface and functionality of the email web application. This ensured that the design was translated into code, taking into account responsiveness and compatibility across different devices and browsers.
 
To begin using py4mail, we recommend reviewing our [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XgjrZY7rXYCJ02byCELfqm1AaKpADnwYl5Wegd5XHpY/edit?usp=sharing). This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on enrolling and sending messages using py4mail. Additionally, it offers insights into the design principles we employed and the dynamics of our team during the project's development. This [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwccH8KHGmGwVgCk6Ct0DpWRstz1xQFKqzbVGp4U9hM/edit?usp=sharing) has our **rough** drawing design before creating py4mail.


## Functionality and Features:
As a new user of the email web application, the user should be able to easily create an account. On the starting page, they can log in with existing credentials or choose to sign up for a new account by clicking the "sign up" option, which will redirect them to a sign-up page.

After successfully creating an account, the user should be directed to the inbox page. Here, they can access various functionalities. They should be able to view a list of received emails, click on individual emails to see more details and the email content on a separate page, and have the option to delete or mark emails as starred from the list.

In addition to the email list, the user should have a sidebar available with buttons for quick navigation. The buttons should include options to view sent, starred, deleted, and sent emails.

At the top of the email list, there should be a convenient search bar that allows the user to search for specific users within their inbox. This feature helps them easily locate emails, similar to other popular email applications.

When selecting a specific email from the list, the user should have the ability to take actions such as trashing, blocking, or starring the user. This allows them to review the email content and make decisions on where the email should be directed.
